## 🛠️ GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., `concept-thinking-roadmap`)
4. Make sure it's set to **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. Open terminal/command prompt in this project directory
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add conceptual thinking roadmap"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/[repository-name].git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Access Your Live Site

1. GitHub will build and deploy your site (this may take a few minutes)
2. Once deployed, your site will be available at:
   `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]`
3. You can find the exact URL in the "Pages" section of your repository settings

## 🔄 Updating Your Site

To update your site with new changes:

```bash
# Make your changes to the files
# Then commit and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Update roadmap content"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy your updated site.

## 📝 Notes

- The main entry point for GitHub Pages is `index.html`
- All your CSS and JavaScript is embedded in the HTML file, so no additional build process is needed
- GitHub Pages supports custom domains if you want to use your own domain later
- The site will automatically update whenever you push changes to the main branch
